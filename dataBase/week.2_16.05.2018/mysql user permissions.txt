0. This all applies if we want to create a new user with the username
   nodetodoapp and password equal to mypassword to be able to modify data
   but no create, drop, or alter tables and stores procedures on the
   database named todo_app.

1. First we login normally to mySQL using the MySQL Client
   and check what username we logged in with (at this point it
   is the user we created during installation)

SELECT USER();

Result:

+----------------+
| user()         |
+----------------+
| root@localhost |
+----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

2. We change database to see what users exist on mysql DBMS:

USE mysql;
SELECT user FROM user;

3. Then we create our new user:

CREATE USER 'nodetodoapp'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';

Repeat Step 2 to see that the user got created.

4. Check what databases exist on the DBMS with:

SHOW DATABASES;

On the results we are supposed to have already created the database
named todo_app since this is the database we want to use the new
user for.

5. Give to the new user (nodetodoapp) permissions

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, EXECUTE, TRIGGER on todo_app.* TO 'nodetodoapp'@'localhost';

and flush privileges with

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

6. Connect on the DBMS with the new account.
  - For windows:
    - Open a Command Prompt (the terminal).
      On Windows 7 it is on Start -> Accessories -> Command prompt
    - Change directory with the following command on the prompt
      cd "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\bin\"

      (This is for version 5.7 of MySQL. I guess version 8 will
       be a little bit different. Go to My Computer, C drive, Program Files
       to see the correct path)
    - Open the MySQL Client and connect to the DBMS with the following
      command (notice that near the end it has -unodetodoappuser that is
      the -u parameter and the user name. By default this is -uroot)

      mysql.exe "--defaults-file=C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\my.ini" "-unodetodoapp" "-p"

      Also notice that the path is correct. If not change the 5.7 with the
      correct version

  - For Linux:
    - Open a terminal.
    - Enter mysql -u nodetodoapp -p

7. See the available databases.

SHOW databases;

and use the one we want to use:

USE todo_app;

Try to create a new table with:

CREATE TABLE test_table (id INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT,
  description VARCHAR(255),
  PRIMARY KEY(id));

and it should tell us that the command is denied.

7a. See the available databases.

SHOW databases;

The one we want to use (todo_app) is not there...

We try to create a new one with

CREATE DATABASE todo_app;

and we get access denied message. This happened because we didn't do
Step 5 (didn't give enough permissions to the new user).



UPDATE:
      SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=6
      UPDATE USER set last_name='papadakis' WHERE id=6
      SELECT * FROM user WHERE last_name='papadakis';
