a form element. It contains 2 radio buttons. The first one is already checked.
The submit button is used to submit the form. When we press it the form is
submitted with the method specified in the form's method attribute. This is
an HTTP verb (GET, PUT, POST, ...) and the form (the data of the form) is
submitted in the address specified on the form's action attribute.

what is happening when we press submit. The form's action value is
