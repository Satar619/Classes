  <p>Tetsuo II: Body Hammer (鉄男II Body Hammer) is a 1992 Japanese science

	sequel to Tsukamoto's 1989 film Tetsuo: The Iron Man, utilizing similar
	themes and ideas as his first film (a Japanese salary man, played by cult
	actor Tomorowo Taguchi, finds his body transforming into a weapon through
	sheer rage after his son is kidnapped by a gang of violent thugs).</p>
