- To enter all the contents of a file to the DBMS use the source command.
  For example if we have a file in Windows:
	
	mysql>  source "c:\Users\username\Desktop\filename.sql
	
	or in Linux
	
	mysql> source /home/username/Desktop/filename.sql

- Another way to enter the contents of the file is to copy paste them.

Necessary steps to populate the database with the United Nations data:

Step 1: Create a database and use it. For example:
        mysql> CREATE DATABASE UNmembers;
				mysql> USE UNmembers;

Step 2: Copy the un.sql file somewhere. Be prepared to provide the path to
        the next command.
				
Step 3: mysql> source path\un.sql (in Windows)
        mysql> source path/un.sql (in Linux)
				
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we have the data in the database we can use SELECT and other commands.
Examples ( I use JavaScript style comments):
  
mysql> SHOW TABLES;

mysql> DESCRIBE unitedNations;

mysql> SELECT name, internetTLD FROM unitedNations;

mysql> SELECT name, internetTLD FROM unitedNations LIMIT 10;

mysql> SELECT name, population FROM unitedNations ORDER BY population;

mysql> SELECT name, population FROM unitedNations ORDER BY population DESC;

mysql> SELECT name, population FROM unitedNations ORDER BY population DESC LIMIT 3;

mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM unitedNations;
// Return how many there are

mysql> SELECT COUNT(name) FROM unitedNations;
// Count them based on the column name. Include duplicates

mysql> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) FROM unitedNations;
// As before but count as 1 the values that are exactly the same in different rows.

mysql> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT admissionDate) FROM unitedNations;
// As before but now we see that for some nations the value of admissionDate is the same.

// to make it more clear
mysql> SELECT admissionDate FROM unitedNations;
mysql> SELECT admissionDate FROM unitedNations ORDER BY admissionDate DESC;
mysql> SELECT DISTINCT admissionDate FROM unitedNations ORDER BY admissionDate DESC;

mysql> SELECT id,name FROM unitedNations WHERE admissionDate='1945-10-24';

mysql> SELECT COUNT(name), admissionDate FROM unitedNations GROUP BY admissionDate;
// Show how many countries admitted members in each date

mysql> SELECT COUNT(name) AS 'Number of countries', admissionDate FROM unitedNations GROUP BY admissionDate;
// As before but name the first column 'Number of countries' by using the AS
// To make it more clear enter both commands with LIMIT. For example:
mysql> SELECT COUNT(name), admissionDate FROM unitedNations GROUP BY admissionDate LIMIT 4;
mysql> SELECT COUNT(name) AS 'Number of countries', admissionDate FROM unitedNations GROUP BY admissionDate LIMIT 4;
