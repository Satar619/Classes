      <em><h2>Read More About History</h2><em>
  <p><em><b>World Championship Wrestling</b>, Inc. (WCW) was an American professional wrestling promotion, historically based inAtlanta, Georgia. It began as a regional (mid-Atlantic U.S.), National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)-affiliated "territory" promotion – Jim Crockett Promotions – until November 1988, when Ted Turner (through his Turner Broadcasting System business) bought the promotion, whose struggle to compete with Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (now World Wrestling Entertainment, or WWE) had left it near bankruptcy. Immediately after the buyout, the business was renamed the Universal Wrestling Corporation (UWC) and consisted of Crockett's business assets not picked up by World Wrestling Federation Entertainment. In its early years, WCW was buoyed by established NWA performers such as Ric Flair and Dusty Rhodes, along with emerging stars like Lex Luger, and Sting, who would go on to be dubbed "The Franchise of WCW".<br>

  In the mid-1990s, WCW dramatically improved its economic performance, largely due to the promotion of Eric Bischoff to Executive Producer; the hiring of former WWF main eventers Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, Roddy Piper and Diesel (Kevin Nash); the introduction of the Monday Nitro series on cable TV, and the resultant Monday Night Wars with the WWF's Monday Night Raw; the creative and marketing execution of the New World Order (nWo) brand/stable of wrestlers, which involved Hulk Hogan's shift from perennial fan-favorite to prominent villain; and other innovative concepts. WCW also developed a popular cruiserweight division, which showcased an acrobatic, fast-paced, lucha libre-inspired style of wrestling.<br><br>

  Over the next several years, the promotion facilitated the main event rise of performers such as Bill Goldberg, Scott Hall, Booker T, Diamond Dallas Page, Scott Steiner, Jeff Jarrett, Chris Benoit and The Giant (later Big Show in the WWF). WCW eclipsed the WWF in popularity throughout the United States for much of the latter-1990s, however, numerous financial and creative missteps led to the company losing its lead over the WWF. Turner (and later, Time Warner) owned WCW until 2001, when selected assets were purchased by the WWF.[8][9] Since 2001, WCW images and video footage have been widely distributed in WWE-owned media.<br><br>

  Two separate subsidiary companies exist as successors to WCW. WCW, Inc. is the WWE subsidiary established in Delaware in late 2000, initially as W. Acquisition Company, which holds the rights to the WCW video library and other intellectual property.[10] The former WCW entity, which retained liabilities not acquired by WWF, was renamed back to the Universal Wrestling Corporation;[11] it is still listed as a subsidiary of Time Warner</em>.</p>
