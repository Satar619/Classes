    <div class="flex-item"> A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is
      a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole
      of nature in its beauty.” <br> ― Albert Einstein

  <p id="wrestling"><em>Wrestling motivational quotes are intended to inspire you to do your best on the mat. No other sport will push an individual to their limit in such a short period of time as wrestling. The oldest recorded sport, wrestling pits one will against another in primal combat.
All former wrestlers on any level have a bond that is knowing what it takes to prepare and be competitive at this sport.

Team sports build a person in a totally different way. When you are on the mat it is just you and the man across the mat. There is no one else to blame for your failures, and no one else feel the pump of success. There is a place for team sports, camaraderie, and the like. This is not that place.

You will never learn more about yourself than you will by being a wrestler.

Here is a great motivational quote for wrestling. It is about life but when you read it you will know it is really for wrestlers.

"It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory.<em></p>
