## Homework week 1:

>[Here](https://github.com/SocialHackersCodeSchool/JavaScript/tree/master/Week1/README.md) you find the readings you have to complete before the second lecture.

## Before you start with the homework:

1. Watch: [What is programming](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/intro-to-programming/v/programming-intro) Just watch the 2 min video, you do not have to do the entire JavaScript course (It could be useful later on though). 

## Step 1: JavaScript

> For all the following exercises create a new .js file. Try to find a proper name for each file or make a small comment about what it does inside for future reference

1. Declare a variable `x` and initialize it with an integer.

2. How do you round the number 7.25, to the nearest integer?

3. Create a array called `colors` with the strings red, green and blue inside.

4. How can you find the length of the string you just created?

5. Write a program that checks the types of two variables and prints out `SAME TYPE` if they are the same type. 
For example: 
    
    let x = 9;
    let y = 'Hello';

    if () {
      console.log('SAME TYPE');
    }


6. If `x` equals 7, and the only other statement is `x = x % 3`, what would be the new value of `x`?

### Step 2: **Some freeCodeCamp challenges (10 hours):**

On freeCodeCamp.com please do the [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/map) exercises up and until the __"Shopping List"__ exercise (there are some topics we did not cover but you can do it).

### How to hand in Homework:
```
steps:
• Create a Github account
• Create a new repository (name it something like sha-javascript1) make sure you select the option: initialize with README
• inside this repository create a folder "week1"
• Upload the files you created on your computer inside the week1 folder, write a description for this “commit”
• Open the file in your README to check if this all worked

• Create a new repository "sha-javascript1". Also create a new folder "week1" inside this repository. 
• Upload your homework files inside the week1 folder and write a description for this “commit”.
• Your sha-javascript1/week1 should now contain all your homework files.
```

### Hint
If you solve the FreeCodeCamp challenges and they are new concepts to you and you would like to take a look at them later on in the program, Copy your answers from FCC in a .js file and upload them to Github in a repository for future reference. In this way you build your own little documentation, if you look back at them first try to understand what it does before you run them.
